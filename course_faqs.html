       <h3>What makes you think to help the people get a JOB?</h3>
				<p>A decade ago, I went through the class room courses in not just one Institute and tried in multiple institutes with the intention just to get a job,
not knowing anything about the industry and how to get a JOB, I tried hard to get my resume shortlisted, finally I could get an opportunity to attend at interview, 
but the interview experience is totally different and I couldn't answer even 1 question. I took more than 6 months to just understand what IT industry is and what kind of people they need. I am sure many out there are struggling for guidance and guided by many working people in a completely wrong way to learn this technology and that technology with out letting them know how to get a JOB.
<p>Every one teaches a course( not sure how much is really important to get a JOB) but no one teaches how to get a JOB, I approached many training institutes, consultancies. Everyone talks a lot about the very very long list of the items they cover in the course, of course 90%, of the content doesn't really need to get a JOB.			 
<p>Every one teaches a course but no one teaches how I can learn all the technologies needed to get a Job as early as possible.  
Along the way, I discovered what is needed to get a JOB in IT industry and what one just need to learn to be an automation Engineer.I repeat just only those tools.

<h3>Are you Just giving the guidance, not the Job? why should I pay?</h3>
<p>Yes, I describe myself as a strategist, not a trainer and I strongly believe that guidance will only help you get a job more than anything. I believe everyone is capable enough to learn on their own in this digital world if proper guidance is given. Exactly, I am doing that but I own the responsibility of placing you.I teach you how to learn a tool as quickly as possible and how to put the strategies into practice.In a traditional training, faculty puts 90% effort and student puts only 10% effort, that is why the success rate is not more than 10%. But, here I put 10% effort to train you on technology and 90% focus is to develop your employability skills, techniques to learn anything on your own, facing interview with confidence and other most important skills what employers seek from the candidates.That is why our students are successful in getting the jobs in less than 6 months.

<h3>What do I need ? a training or JOB.</h3>
<p>If you just need training, it is definitely a bad idea to approach JALA Technologies. You can find hundreds of training resources out there for as low as $10 to $100.
This is only for the people who are dead serious about their JOB or career in automation Testing. This program is certainly not for lazy engineers or want to continue in manual testing for ever.
<p>If you need a JOB as an automation engineer, you are required to practice 480 hours and it is a one-time effort. 
You will get the confidence and all the skills to survive in this volatile IT market.
<p>	Yes, You need to come here to take an offer with you not just to learn something. I only teach what is needed to get a JOB right from the resume preparation to holding an offer.			
				
<h3>How do I know this program works? </h3>
<p>Yes, it works absolutely if you have decided to spend 480 hours. You just need to be prepared to stretch a little and think beyond the normal. Of course, it is worth spending those number of hours to stand out from the heavy competition and meeting the unclear expectations of the employers.		

<h3>Is there a JOB guarantee?</h3>
<p>Yes, The Job is definitely guaranteed but what is important is, in how many months? This program is deliberately prepared with utmost importance and experts guidance to cover most things needed to get a JOB in 3 months to 6 months. Everyone gets a job in indefinite time but we expect everyone to have the first offer with in 6 months. 
The agreement you may have with JALA Technologies will hold value only for 6 months. You are free to continue.

<h3>How can I expect Return On Investment?</h3>
<p>Well, You are thinking like an investor. I personally like investors as they can see the return on investment on every minute they spend, Once they see it they never step back. I always like these Quotes, Imagination has a great deal to do with winning. Imagination always wins. 
I am sure you make many times return on your investment and immediately with in SIX months.I don't believe in any course which can not offer an immediate return on investment.

<h3>Is this course easy to do for anyone?</h3>
<p>Absolutely! , We made it simple with the best teaching techniques. You do not need to learn by heart a single line. You learn everything by doing, learning is relevant and practical, not just passive and theoretical.So, You enjoy every minute of training and you feel that you are carrying a load of practical experience everyday home. You just need to be self-accountable, disciplined and focused.We will take care of your long-lasting career.

<h3>How do I measure myself that I am on track to get a JOB?</h3>
