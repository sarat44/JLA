       <h3>What makes you think to help the people get a JOB?</h3>
				<p>A decade ago, I went through the class room courses in not just one Institute and tried in multiple institutes with the intention just to get a job,
not knowing anything about the industry and how to get a JOB, I tried hard to get my resume shortlisted, finally I could get an opportunity to attend at interview, 
but the interview experience is totally different and I couldn't answer even 1 question. I took more than 6 months to just understand what IT industry is and what kind of people they need. I am sure many out there are struggling for guidance and guided by many working people in a completely wrong way to learn this technology and that technology with out letting them know how to get a JOB.
<p>Every one teaches a course( not sure how much is really important to get a JOB) but no one teaches how to get a JOB, I approached many training institutes, consultancies. Everyone talks a lot about the very very long list of the items they cover in the course, of course 90%, of the content doesn't really need to get a JOB.			 
<p>Every one teaches a course but no one teaches how I can learn all the technologies needed to get a Job as early as possible.  
Along the way, I discovered what is needed to get a JOB in IT industry and what one just need to learn to be an automation Engineer.I repeat just only those tools.

<h3>Are you Just giving the guidance, not the Job? why should I pay?</h3>
<p>Yes, I describe myself as a strategist, not a trainer and I strongly believe that guidance will only help you get a job more than anything. I believe everyone is capable enough to learn on their own in this digital world if proper guidance is given. Exactly, I am doing that but I own the responsibility of placing you.I teach you how to learn a tool as quickly as possible and how to put the strategies into practice.In a traditional training, faculty puts 90% effort and student puts only 10% effort, that is why the success rate is not more than 10%. But, here I put 10% effort to train you on technology and 90% focus is to develop your employability skills, techniques to learn anything on your own, facing interview with confidence and other most important skills what employers seek from the candidates.That is why our students are successful in getting the jobs in less than 6 months.

<h3>What do I need ? a training or JOB.</h3>
<p>If you just need training, it is definitely a bad idea to approach BrightITCareer. You can find hundreds of training resources out there for as low as $10 to $100.
This is only for the people who are dead serious about their JOB or career in automation Testing. This program is certainly not for lazy engineers or want to continue in manual testing for ever.
<p>If you need a JOB as an automation engineer, you are required to practice 480 hours and it is a one-time effort. 
You will get the confidence and all the skills to survive in this volatile IT market.
<p>	Yes, You need to come here to take an offer with you not just to learn something. I only teach what is needed to get a JOB right from the resume preparation to holding an offer.			
				
<h3>How do I know this program works? </h3>
<p>Yes, it works absolutely if you have decided to spend 480 hours. You just need to be prepared to stretch a little and think beyond the normal. Of course, it is worth spending those number of hours to stand out from the heavy competition and meeting the unclear expectations of the employers.		

<h3>Is there a JOB guarantee?</h3>
<p>Yes, The Job is definitely guaranteed but what is important is, in how many months? This program is deliberately prepared with utmost importance and experts guidance to cover most things needed to get a JOB in 3 months to 6 months. Everyone gets a job in indefinite time but we expect everyone to have the first offer with in 6 months. 
The agreement you may have with BrightITCareer will hold value only for 6 months. You are free to continue.

<h3>How can I expect Return On Investment?</h3>
<p>Well, You are thinking like an investor. I personally like investors as they can see the return on investment on every minute they spend, Once they see it they never step back. I always like these Quotes, Imagination has a great deal to do with winning. Imagination always wins. 
I am sure you make many times return on your investment and immediately with in SIX months.I don't believe in any course which can not offer an immediate return on investment.

<h3>Is this course easy to do for anyone?</h3>
<p>If it is easy everyone will be here and we don't want just any one who is looking for easy career options. You may hate every minute of training.If you do not quit then success is yours. This is a very serious Intensive training Program and need to be finished with in 3 to 6 months with offer at hand

<h3>How do I measure myself that I am on track to get a JOB?</h3>
<p>Everything about this course is designed for efficiency. You will have detailed Day wise program to follow. The best videos are collected to share with you during the program.

<h3>Shall I get real time experience?</h3>
<p>Yes, This course is designed only to give you a real time experience, thereby you can perform well in the job.
BrightITCareer will continue giving support even after successful placement. 

<h3> How do you trust us as you are not charging up front?</h3>
<p>We believe in expecting professionals to enroll in this course.

<h3>Am I planning to take a manual testing course before going to selenium?</h3>
<p>Not really required, we cover the manual testing concepts as part of the course which is needed to get complete knowledge on Testing.
You will be learning lot many technologies. It won't take much time to get to the speed.

<h3>What kind of assistance is given during the project?</h3>
<p>You will be doing a project from Day1. We teach everything through the project so that you will be ready for giving interviews from Day 1. 
This program is completely Project based training, everyone has to do a project and there will be daily assignments.
You will not move to next day assignment with out completing the previous day assignment.

<h3>How are you so confident about the Opportunities to attend an interview at least one every week?</h3>
<p>You will see the result in a matter of days. We have been in guiding and placing the candidates over 8 years. We know how to get your resume shortlisted.
<p>The rule is: Everyone has to fail at least 8 interviews which approximately takes 2 months. As per our past experience, most candidates could get JOB with 10 attempts.
<p>We analyze every interview after failure and the candidate will be guided based on that.
			  
<h3>I am currently working and want to do selenium Project, Not really looking for a JOB?</h3>
<p>This program is only for serious JOB seekers not for the folks who just want to learn Selenium. As you are learning many tools, if you are not serious about the JOB, 
<p>You may not give your best to complete the assignments in time.You will not move to next day assignment with out completing the previous day assignment.
<p>We may open a batch in the future for the people who want to do Selenium Live Project. Please visit our website a few months later.

<h3>Will I involve in FRAMEWORK development for the LIVE project?</h3
<p>Yes, You will develop Framework for the projects that you will be working from scratch, that's how the candidates are going to get the confidence to claim 7+ Years experience as an automation Engineer/Architect/SDET.
<p>Our systematic FAIL and CORRECT your mistakes approach will make you get the most of this program in a very short span of time.And, I am sure you will be able to show off that real debugging experience.

<h3>What if I miss some sessions due to some reasons?</h3>
<p>It's mandatory to complete Daily assignments for everyone. You need to spend more hours or use week ends to cover the backlogs.

<h3>What if I can not continue for any reason?</h3>
<p>It is simply not acceptable unless you have the very strong reason. Because we are investing a huge amount on every candidate all through this program.
<p>We request you to join only when you do not have any vacation plans in the next 3 months.

<h3>I never used to be writing the code. What is the portion of writing code/java programming in the course?</h3>
<p>My answer is 100%. You need to write every minute of the course. This program is designed only for Automation leads up to 10 years experience. 
<p>So you need to prepare to spend a lot of time writing code. Don't worry, It's not as tough as you thought. we know how to teach complex things in a simple way.
